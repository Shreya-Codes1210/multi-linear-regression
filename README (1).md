# Linear Regression – Predicting Canada's Per Capita Income

This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to predict Canada's per capita income based on historical data using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- `canada_per_capita_income.csv`
- Columns: `year`, `per capita income (US$)`
- Source: Reconstructed dataset for educational purposes

---

## 🧠 Key Steps Performed
- Data import and exploration using **pandas**
- Scatter plot visualization with **Seaborn**
- Splitting data into **training and testing sets** using `train_test_split`
- Model building using **LinearRegression** from `sklearn`
- Model prediction and result visualization

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
